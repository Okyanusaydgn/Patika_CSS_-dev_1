        <p>Vitamins are one of your body‚Äôs micronutrients which are usually seen alongside essential minerals, another
            micronutrient. A micronutrient, as opposed to a macronutrient, is a compound that your body requires in
            small quantities. Generally, this amounts to less than 100mg a day.</p>

            <h2>Vitamin B</h2>
            <p>The B vitamins help enzymes in our bodies do their jobs and are important for a wide range of cellular
                functions, like breaking down carbohydrates and transporting nutrients throughout the body. </p>

            <h2>Vitamin D</h2>
            <p>Vitamin D is a crucial vitamin you need to be aware of when you‚Äôre trying to put on muscle. While
                previously, we believed it only plays a vital role in bone health and development due to its role in
                calcium metabolism. However, over the past few years, recent research has shown that it also plays
                several roles in muscle structure and health. It may even help increase testosterone production.</p>

            <h2>Vitamin E</h2>
            <p>Vitamin E is one of the most powerful antioxidants your body utilizes to scavenge free radicals and can
                decrease the build-up of various stresses. It just so happens that when we train, we actually produce a
                lot of oxidative stress. While it was hypothesized that Vitamin E plays a role in mitigating the build-up
                of this stress, along with its negative consequences, we now have studies to prove this to be true.</p>

            <h2>Vitamin C</h2>
            <p>Like Vitamin E, Vitamin C is another powerful antioxidant and immune system booster. In fact, their
                antioxidant properties are so similar that they actually look at their effect together. That being said,
                most of the studies done on humans and Vitamin C have looked at endurance training and its ability to
                decrease fatigue and improve muscle recovery. As far as that‚Äôs concerned, studies do show that a Vitamin
                C deficiency can result in an impaired working capacity.</p>
